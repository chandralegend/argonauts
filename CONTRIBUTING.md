# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! To ensure a smooth collaboration, please follow the steps below:

1. **Create an Issue**: Before starting any work, please create an issue to discuss the changes you plan to make. This allows for better coordination and avoids duplication of efforts.

2. **Create a Pull Request**: Once you have identified the changes you want to make, fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes. Make your modifications and submit a pull request (PR) to the main repository.

3. **Do Your Thing**: Implement your changes according to the project's guidelines and coding standards. Ensure that your code is well-documented and follows best practices.

4. **Run Pre-commit Hooks**: Before submitting your PR, run the pre-commit hooks to ensure that your code adheres to the project's formatting and style guidelines. This helps maintain consistency across the codebase.

5. **Run Tests**: It is essential to run the project's tests to verify that your changes do not introduce any regressions or break existing functionality. Make sure all tests pass successfully before submitting your PR.

6. **Maintainer Review and Merge**: Once your PR is submitted, a project maintainer will review your changes. They may provide feedback or request further modifications. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main repository.

We appreciate your contributions and look forward to working with you!
